<p><font color="#076C9F"><b><font size="5">Create/Edit Custom Keywords</font></b><br></font>
<p>This page controls the default meta description and meta geywords for your site, and is under revision.</p>
<p>For true SEO capability, and the ability to control the individual title, meta description and keywords for each page, please install the MWG "meta" gizmo.</p>
<p>For the record, search engines ignore the keywords field.  The first 150 characters of the meta description is very important as that is the text that will show up 
in search engines like Google. Write it to read like a relevant, mini-advertisement for the page.</p>
<p>Enter your keywords here. The keywords are your 
  services and your products which you sell or promote inside the text from this 
  page (it can be a single word but is preferable to be composed of 2 or 3 words 
  as this is how search engine visitors usually search). It is recommended that 
  you build first your keywords list (search engines makes difference between 
  singular and plural forms) and then make your page text and include them as 
  natural as possible and repeat each keyword several times inside the text. Build 
  your text from the site having in mind your possible clients and not search 
  engines, make them take the action you want. </font>
<p>Please insert them here in order of their importance. Insert 
  first the most important keyword and so on, because your browser title will be automatically generated from the first 3-4 keywords, depending on how many words they contain (because it is recommended not to have more than 9 words in the browser title).</font>
