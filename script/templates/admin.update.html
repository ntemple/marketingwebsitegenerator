<p> Please note, we only update your .php source code files. Not your html 
  templates. If you had any 3rd party &quot;Custom Work&quot; done, please have your 
  installer check so you do not write over the custom code. Please note, any 
  upgrades done to sites that have not had any customer work will keep all your 
  files integrity in tact.<br>
