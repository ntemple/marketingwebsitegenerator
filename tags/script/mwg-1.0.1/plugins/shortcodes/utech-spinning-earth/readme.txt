Put a slowly spinning earth on your site with shortcode. Incredible small file size, realist and rich graphics.


== Description ==


This sophisticated little Flash animation of our spinning planet looks real and can be inserted via simple shortcode. Incredibly it is smaller in file size than many static jpg picutures. It shows the planet earth smoothly spinning in the right direction (!) and will run even with older versions of Flash therefore it is highly compatible. Unlike conventional movie clips, it is extremely small in size (less than 50kB!), yet rich in graphical content. Other rotating globes are either huge in file size or have very basic graphics. A sophisticated algorithm "wraps" a single picture around a sphere, and therefore produces the best of both worlds; a small file *and* great looking graphics.


**Quick Start**

Put the following shortcode anywhere on your post or page to insert the Spinning Earth:

    `[spinningearth]`  

	
Use the 'size' parameter to change the size of the planet:

    `[spinningearth size=100]`  


Change background color to black and set size to 160:

    `[spinningearth size=160 color=000000]`
